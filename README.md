👉 This lays out a **nested tree**:
Molecule → Cell → Tissue → Organ → System → Agent → Relationship → Household → Enterprise → Platform.

It has the recursive **biological → social → enterprise** gradient you like, but the table and icons make it easier to scan, almost like a **subway map of scale**.

I've transformed your digital twins hierarchy system into a modern, aesthetically pleasing visualization. The design features:

- **Glassmorphism aesthetic** with translucent backgrounds and blur effects
- **Dynamic gradient animations** on the title and interactive elements
- **Hierarchical flow** with visual connection lines between levels
- **Interactive hover effects** that highlight relationships
- **Floating particle animations** for ambient visual interest
- **Modern typography** and color coding for each level
- **Preserved functionality** - the enterprise link remains clickable

The hierarchy flows from molecular level up through biological and social scales to platform level, with each component clearly labeled and visually distinct. The design emphasizes the interconnected nature of your digital twin system while maintaining clean, professional aesthetics suitable for technical presentations.
